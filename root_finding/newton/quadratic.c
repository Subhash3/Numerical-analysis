/*
This program is used to find the roots of an equation by using newton method. In this method an initial guess X0 is taken and is iterated by the equation
                   Xn+1 = Xn - f(Xn)/df(xn-1)
Where df is the derivative of the function f(x) with respect to x.

Input : -An intital guess (X0)

Algorithm : 
   A new approximation to the root can be found by using 
   Xn+1 = Xn - (f(Xn)/df(Xn))

Output : - Root(s) of the equation f(x) = 0
